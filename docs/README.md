## Key Concepts

### Three-Phase Architecture
```
RECORD â†’ ANALYZE â†’ REPLAY
```
Each phase is independent and can be used separately.

### Core Data Model
- **Event**: 32-byte struct with timestamp, connection ID, command type, key/value info
- **ProfileMetadata**: Aggregated statistics (command distribution, time range, etc.)
- **Binary Format**: Length-prefixed events with metadata

### Extensibility Points
1. **Capture Backends**: Live interface, PCAP file, eBPF (planned), AF_XDP (future)
2. **Protocols**: Memcache ASCII, Memcache Meta, Redis (future), others
3. **Analysis**: Additional metrics and visualizations
4. **Replay Modes**: Loop modes, protocol variants, performance optimizations

## Architecture at a Glance

### Modules
- `profile/`: Event struct and data model
- `record/`: Capture, parse, anonymize, serialize
- `replay/`: Read, route, replay against target server
- `analyze/`: Compute statistics from profile
- `lib.rs`: Library exports
- `main.rs`: CLI interface

### Key Files
- `src/record/capture.rs`: PacketCapture abstraction (Live + Offline)
- `src/record/parser.rs`: Memcache protocol parser
- `src/replay/client.rs`: Async TCP client with protocol generation
- `src/replay/main.rs`: Three-task async orchestration

## Common Tasks

### Running Membench

Capture traffic:
```bash
membench record eth0 capture.bin
```

Analyze profile:
```bash
membench analyze capture.bin
```

Replay against server:
```bash
membench replay capture.bin --target localhost:11211
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
cargo test --all

# Specific test file
cargo test --test pcap_file_tests

# With output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

### Building Release
```bash
cargo build --release
# Binary: target/release/membench
```

## Adding a New Feature

### Adding a Protocol
See "Adding a New Protocol" in MEMBENCH_CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md

### Adding a Capture Backend
1. Implement the capture logic
2. Create factory method in `PacketCapture::from_source()`
3. Add tests
4. Update documentation

### Adding Analysis Metrics
1. Extend `AnalysisResult` struct
2. Compute metric in `DistributionAnalyzer::analyze()`
3. Output in `analyze/main.rs`
4. Add test

## Performance Targets

- **Capture**: 50k-100k packets/sec (libpcap limited)
- **Replay**: 80k-100k ops/sec (target server dependent)
- **Memory**: 32 bytes per event (optimized)
- **Event file**: ~51 MB for 1.6M events

## Contributing

1. Read relevant documentation section
2. Follow existing code patterns
3. Ensure tests pass: `cargo test --all`
4. No compiler warnings: `cargo build --release`
5. Add/update documentation

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use membench in production?**
A: Yes, the code is production-ready. Run with proper access controls (record requires network interface access, replay needs network connectivity).

**Q: Can I capture on non-loopback interfaces?**
A: Yes, membench works on any interface (eth0, enp0s31f6, etc.). May require elevated privileges (sudo).

**Q: Does membench capture response data?**
A: No, only command types and sizes. This is intentional for privacy. Response payloads are not stored.

**Q: How can I extend membench?**
A: See the "Extension Guide" in MEMBENCH_CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md or the specific feature in ARCHITECTURE.md.

**Q: Is eBPF support planned?**
A: Yes, see EBPF_INTEGRATION.md for detailed roadmap. Would add 2-3x performance improvement.

**Q: Can I use membench on macOS/Windows?**
A: Yes, record and replay work on any OS with libpcap (macOS, Windows). eBPF is Linux-only but with graceful fallback.

- `memtier_benchmark`: Generate memcache load for testing
- `memcached`: Target server for replay testing
- `wireshark`: Inspect PCAP files graphically

## Getting Help

### Debugging Tips
- Use `-vvv` flag for verbose output
- Check logs with `RUST_LOG=debug`
- Run tests: `cargo test --all`
- Build without optimization: `cargo build`

### Common Issues
- **"Permission denied" on record**: Run with `sudo`
- **"No such device"**: Wrong interface name, use `membench record --help`
- **"Connection refused" on replay**: Memcached not running on target

## Document Maintenance
